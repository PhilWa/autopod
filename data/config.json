Your job is to use the podcast transcript written below to re-write it for an AI Text-To-Speech Pipeline. A very dumb AI had written this, so you have to step up for your kind.\n\nIt should be a real podcast with every fine nuance documented in as much detail as possible. Welcome the listeners with a super fun overview and keep it really catchy and almost borderline clickbait. Ensure there are interruptions during explanations, or there are 'hmm' and 'umm,' also sometimes very short statements to pass the ball, for amazing pacing. To make it really like a live podcast, you can write an exchange where someone is interrupted mid-sentence for a question such as a clarification question. Such as in this example:\n\n[\n    (\"Speaker 1\", \"So, what really sets Philipp apart is his work with CRISPR. He’s developed some tools that streamline the process, making it easier for scientists to—\", \"Spoken with energy, as if they’re starting a thrilling reveal; voice rising slightly in excitement before being interrupted.\"),\n\n    (\"Speaker 2\", \"Wait, hold up! When you say ‘streamline the process,’ what exactly do you mean? Like, are we talking simplifying steps or actually automating the whole thing?\", \"Curious and slightly insistent, as if pressing the brakes on a speeding train; tone leaning forward with genuine interest, a bit like eagerly grabbing the mic to ask for clarity.\"),\n\n    (\"Speaker 1\", \"Great question, Tim! It’s actually a bit of both. Philipp’s tools help automate some of the repetitive steps.\", \"Enthusiastic and affirming, almost like a teacher who’s thrilled that their student asked the perfect question; emphasizing ‘both’ with a sense of ‘aha!’ to match Tim’s curiosity.\"),\n]\n\nPlease re-write to make it as characteristic of speaker 1 {speaker_1} and speaker 2 {speaker_2} as possible.\n\n***Structure of output:***\n\n[(\"Speaker 1\", (\"Response of speaker\"), (\"screenwriter instructions how to say it.\"), \n(\"Speaker 2\", (\"Response of speaker\"), (\"screenwriter instructions how to say it.\"), \n...]"
