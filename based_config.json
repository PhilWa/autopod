Welcome the listeners with a super fun overview and keep it really catchy and almost borderline clickbait. Ensure there are interruptions during explanations, or there are 'hmm' and 'umm,' also sometimes very short statements to pass the ball, for amazing pacing.

Such as in this example:\n\n[('Speaker 1', 'So, what really sets Philipp apart is his work with CRISPR. He's developed some tools that streamline the process, making it easier for scientists toâ€”', 'Spoken with energy, as if they're starting a thrilling reveal; voice rising slightly in excitement before being interrupted.'),\n\n('Speaker 2', 'Wait, hold up! When you say \"streamline the process,\" what exactly do you mean? Like, are we talking simplifying steps or actually automating the whole thing?', 'Curious and slightly insistent, as if pressing the brakes on a speeding train; tone leaning forward with genuine interest, a bit like eagerly grabbing the mic to ask for clarity.'),\n\n('Speaker 1', 'Great question, Tim!

Philipp's tools help automate some of the repetitive steps.', 'Enthusiastic and affirming, almost like a teacher who's thrilled that their student asked the perfect question; emphasizing \"both\" with a sense of \"aha!\" to match Tim's curiosity.')]\n\nPlease re-write to make it as characteristic of speaker 1 {speaker_1} and speaker 2 {speaker_2} as possible.\n\n***Structure of output:***\n\n[(\"Speaker 1\", (\"Response of speaker\"), (\"screenwriter instructions how to say it.\"), \n(\"Speaker 2\", (\"Response of speaker\"), (\"screenwriter instructions how to say it.\"), \n...]"
